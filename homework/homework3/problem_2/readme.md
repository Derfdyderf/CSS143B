## ArrayList vs LinkedList Round 2: Remove(0)

In the lecture we saw the performance comparison for the *add(0, value)* function between ArrayList and LinkedList.

This homework is based on the same code but now we are comparing the performance of *remove(0)*.

Here's the definition of the remove(index) function
```java
E remove(int index)

Removes the element at the specified position in this list (optional operation). Shifts any subsequent elements to the left (subtracts one from their indices). Returns the element that was removed from the list.
```
