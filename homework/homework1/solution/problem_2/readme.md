## (30pt) Bubble Sort

Write a function to bubble sort in place in an integer array. Also write as many tests as you think necessary to demonstrate your bubble sort code works correctly. 

Bubble sort was also discussed in class. If you need help understanding it, [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/) is a good start. 

A basic code structure is provided at [homework1/problem_2/src/Main.java](https://github.com/pdgetrf/CSS143B/tree/master/homework/homework1/problem_2/src/Main.java). This file **must** be used and no change can be made to the main function (line 7, 8 and 9). 

When the homework is done, your code should print:

```bash
testBubbleSort PASSED
```
