### Problems To Solve

### Tests

We are using [JUnit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/) for testing from this homework on. The Junit libraries are provided in [this folder](https://github.com/pdgetrf/CSS143B/tree/master/homework/homework5/junit). Please download both jar files to your desktop and add to your IDE. Note that we are not using build tools such as Maven. The steps to add Junit to project simply means adding the jar files to the project as libraries. [Here](https://www.360logica.com/blog/how-to-use-junit-library-in-java-project/) is a good instruction.
