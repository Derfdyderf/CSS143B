## (20pt) Binary Search

Implement binary search **recursively**

This binary search returns the **array index** of the found target in the array. It returns -1 if target is not found.

Please add your iterative binary search from homework 1 to Main.java. The given tests will check both answers should match with the expected answer. 

If there are multiple occurances of the target in the array, return the first one found. In this case the iterative solution might need to be updated to be consistent with the recursive version.
