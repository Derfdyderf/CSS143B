The following are some guidelines for midterm 2. 

How to implement Stack and Queue with LinkedList? Do you use the head or tail for each operation?
Difference in performance and utility between using array and linked list to implement stack and queue

LinkedList
	dummy node vs without dummy node, why using a dummy node? what does dummy node store?
	different memory layout of array vs linked list
	single vs double linked list
	code:
		insert to front and end, delete from front and end
		reverse linkedlist iteratively
		how to find if there's loop in a linked list
	different between ArrayList and LinkedList (note, one word here meaning it's referring to java.util class)

Recursion
	stoping condition
	the memory layout for function calls
	memory stack vs memry heap. object created with new, is it in heap or stack?
	StackOverflowError,  stack overflow attack
	recursive sum, iterative sum
	repeated subproblem and how to fix it? (unique paths, fibonacci sequence)
	concept of backtracking in examples like unique paths and climbing stairs
	code: 
		print single linked list backward with a stack or recursion.
		binary search (recursive and iterative)
		quick sort, assuming partition function is given

Binary Tree
	A search problem: search in a random array, what are the methods and what are the pros and cons
	Binary tree, binary search tree, definition
	pre-order, in-order and post-order traversal
	code: all 3 traversal with recurison, pre-order iteratively
	code: 
		how to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree
		height of a tree
		tree being balanced or not. how to check
		LCA of binary search tree
		perform a search in a binary search tree
