**All choice questions are single choice**

**1. Which of the following naturally suggests a recursive solution?**

- (A) linear search over a set of characters.
- (B) binary search over an unsorted data set.
- (C) multiplication of two numbers.
- (D) printing a message to the console. 

**2. Write the code to reverse a single linked list iteratively.** 

Definition for the single linked list is

```java
 public class ListNode {
     int val;
     ListNode next;
     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 }
```

The list ***has a dummy node***. The reverse function ***CANNOT*** 

- use any collection such as array, stack, queue
- create any new node
- change the content of val in any node
- use recursion

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverse(ListNode head) {
        
      
    }
}
```

**3. Describe how quicksort works and explain how its relation to recursion**

```bash



```

**4. What is the pre-order, in-order and post-order traversal of the following tree**

```bash
          2
        /   \
       4     5
      /
     3
```

pre-order:



In-order:



post-order:



**5. Answer the following questions about the climbing stair problem**

For a staircase with  *n (n>0)* steps. If each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. 

Write the code to calculate how many how many unique ways can you climb to the top **recursively**. Ok to add helper function.

```java
class Solution {
  public int climbStairs(int n) {
        
   
    
    
    
    
    
  }
}
```
